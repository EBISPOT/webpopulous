== Introduction

Webulous is an application-suite for collaborative ontology development. Webulous is designed to support authoring ontologies by getting users to populate ontology design patterns via simple user interfaces.
Webulous has been designed to support a scenario where knowledge about a domain is collected in spreadsheets and transformed into statements within an ontology according to pre-defined ontology design patterns.

Webulous is comprised of two components: the Webulous server, and the Google Spreadsheet add-on. The Webulous server is used for administrating ontology building templates and handles the transformation of spreadsheets into an ontology.
The Webulous Google Sheet Add-on servers as a client to the Webulous server and allows templates to be loaded form the Webulous server, and allows users to submit populated templates back to the server for processing.

The Webulous Google Sheet Add-on can also be used as a generic application for searching ontologies in the NCBO bioportal and provides a convenient way to create data validations according to ontology terms.

== Webulous Google Add-on

The Webulous Google Sheet Add-on has been developed to support working with Webulous templates within Google docs. You can use the add-on to search BioPortal ontologies via a dedicated side bar.
Those ontologies can be used to subsequently create data validations on a selection of cells, in order to provide both validation of user input and autocomplete functionality.
Webulous should be used to create templates where a user needs to validate their data or align it to existing ontologies or controlled vocabulary terms.

=== Availability

The Webulous Add-on is available from the Google Add-ons store. (The Add-on is currently in the process of being processed, please contact us for a developer preview)

=== Installation

You can install the Webulous Add-on directly from a Google Sheet document. Please visit the Add-on store from the menu and search for Webulous. Once installed the Webulous options will be available in your menu

=== User Guide

==== Using the NCBO BioPortal search

Select the ‘Ontology Search’ option from the Webulous menu. This will open a side bar where you can search across the ontologies loaded into the NCBO BioPortal.
By default the search is across all ontologies in BioPortal, but you can restrict the search to a specific ontology by selecting the ontology in the drop down list of ontologies.

The search results show the matching ontology terms and includes the primary label, ontology name, ontology URI and a short description for that term.
You can click on a term to be taken directly to the term page on BioPortal, or you can use the “insert” link to copy and paste the label directly into your active selection of cells.

==== Creating data validations

The primary purpose of the Ontology Search sidebar is for finding terms to create data valiadations. Data validations allow you to restrict what values are possible for a range of cells in the active spreadsheet.
Cells that have data validations will show people a warning if the data they enter is invalid (i.e. doesn’t match a term label in the validation list).
Validations also create a handy drop down list of terms and support autocomplete to assist the user in entering a valid term.

Webulous supports the creation of data validations based on ontology term labels. To create a data validation from an ontology you must first search for the root term used to create your validations.
We can illustrate this by creating a data validation on a column for cell types from the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO).

* Select a column in your spreadsheet where you want to create a data validation
* Open the “Ontology Search” sidebar.
* Select EFO from the drop down list of ontologies.
* Search for “organism”.
* Mouse over the term for “organism” and two buttons will appear
** Selecting Sublcasses will create a data validation that includes the selected term and all direct subclasses of that term
** Selecting Descendants will create a data validation that includes the selected term and all descendants of that term (full transitive closure of child terms)

The validation list will be generated in the background and for large term lists you need to be patient while the data is fetched from BioPortal and the validation is created.
Once complete a pop-up will appear and you will see that the selected cells have changed and now include a downward pointing icon to indicate that there is a validation on those cells.
You should now be able to select a cell to see the list of terms, or simply start typing to get an autocomplete box.

You can add more terms to an existing data validation using a similar methos. Select the existing validation that you want to add more terms to and then follow the same process above.
For example, we could also add ‘cell lines’ to the organism validation above. Webulous will detect that you are in an existing data validation, get all either the subclasses of descendants of ‘cell line’ and merge these into the existing validation.

==== Removing data validations

===== To remove validation in a single cell:
To remove a validation from a single cell, you can do this through the standard Data -> Validations option in Google Sheets.

===== To remove validations associated to the values in the selected range:
You can remove a data validation using the “Remove selected data validation” action in the Webulous menu. This will remove the validation associated with the selected cell.
If the cell you have selected is within an existing validation (such as an entire column) This action will remove all the validations in that column.

===== To remove all validations in the active sheet:
If you want to remove all the validations in the active sheet, use the “Remove all data validations” option from the Webulous menu.

N.B. Webulous does not currently support creating validations across multiple worksheets within a single spreadsheet.

--- IMPORTANT NOTE ---
Webulous does not encourage the implementation of mixed validation restrictions. Please kindly be reminded that, when Webulous generates the OWL classes to be merged to an ontology, it is likely that an ontology relation (i.e., the object property) will be generate to represent relationtionship between two classes, each represented by the value in the associated column.


==== Loading templates from a Webulous server

It is possible to load templates with pre-populated data validation directly from a Webulous server.
The Webulous server is capable of serving more complex data validations, such as those that are constructed from a custom list, ontologies outside of BioPortal, and validation lists based on the results of a DL query.

To load a data submission template from a Webulous server, the Webulous server needs to be running on a public URL accessible by the Google document.
The EBI is currently hosting a read-only Webulous server that you can use to load templatesfor submitting term requests to EFO   (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/webulous).

Open the Webulus menu and go down to the “Webulous server” option, then choose “Load a template…”.  This will open a dialog where you must enter the URL where the Webulous server is running (e.g. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/webulous).
Click the “Get templates” button and a list of available templates will appear in the drop down menu below.
By default Webullou will create a template for 100 rows of data, but if you think you will require more rows, you can set the amount in the input here.
Finally, click the “Load teamplte” button that will create a new sheet in the current spreadsheet with the appropriate data validations pre populated.

N.B. Some templates can be large and may take some time to create all the necessary data validations. These happen asynchronously in the background, so please be patient while the template loads.

==== Filling out Webulous template

For users who work with a pre-populated Webulous template, it is highly recommended that they observe the validation field (a column of which the cells are marked with a drop-down arrow) and only fill in values that can be validated (i.e. can be selected from the drop-down list, or can be auto-filled). The validation fields that cannot be validated will be marked with a red triangle flag in the top-right corner of the field. If you cannot find the desirable value from the drop-down validated value list, please first create this term either by contacting the source ontology of the validation value or submitting a new term in a separate Webulous template (e.g. filling in a cell line template of which a disease associated to that cell line cannot be found needs a separate Webulous submission via a pre-populated disease template). Failure to conform with this recomendation will result in an axiomatisation that points to a non-classified null class in the output file.

Some fields may accept multiple values (e.g. synonyms), these fields read a double-piped delimited string. For example, Rienhoff syndrome are synonymous with Loeys-Dietz syndrome 5, or LDS-5. The synonym field should be filled as "Loyes-Dietz syndrome 5 || LDS-5". Webulous will generate multiple fields for these synonyms in the output file.

In a template customized for the use of class creation with the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO), you may see a definition_citation field. This is an annotation field that aims to keep track of the reference of the term being created from the source that records the term (or its synonyms) in a similar context. The source of definition citation is not restricted to any format of structure. Therefore, a definition citation may be a URL, an entry ID from a dictionary, or another ontology. Definition citation fields are also used as a cross-reference annotation. Filling out definition_citation field in EFO-specific templates requires a specific string format of "[source]:[ID]". For example, "thrombocytopenia" has a MeSH Unique ID: D013921. When filling out MeSH_definition_citation field, the user should put in "MSH:D013921" (without space before and after :) as the field value.

Below are some examples of prefix for definition_citation field.

ATCC_definition_citation prefix "ATCC:[ATCC catalog number]"

ChEBI_definition_citation prefix "ChEBI:[ChEBI number]"

ChEBML_definition_cittion prefix "ChEMBL:[ChEMBL number]"

CL_definition_citation prefix "CL:000xxxx"

CLO_definition_citation prefix "CLO:000xxxx"

GO_definition_citation prefix "GO:00xxxxx"

ICD9_definition_citation prefix "ICD9:[ICD9 number]"

ICD10_definition_citation prefix "ICD10:[ICD10 number]"

MSH_definition_citation prefix "MSH:[MeSH Unique ID]"

NCI_Thesaurus_definition_citation prefix "NCIt:Cxxx"

PMID_definition_citation prefix "PMID:[PMID number]"

SNOMEDCT_definition_citation prefix "SNOMEDCT:[SNOMED ID]"

UMLS_definition_citation preffix "UMLS:[CUI]"

Wikipedia_definition_citation prefix "Wikipedia:[string]"


==== Submitting data to Webulous

Once you have loaded a template and populated it with some data, you can submit that data back to the Webulous server where you loaded the template.
In the Webulous menu, under “Webulous server”, choose “Submit populated template”. A dialog will open showing the address where the data will be submitted, along with two input fields.
The first is where you can submit a short message to accompany the submission. This message is optional, but it is advised that you enter something relevant so that the Webulous administrators can easily identify your submission in any future correspondence.
The second option is for a URIGen API key, this is only relevant for templates that have an accompanying URIGen server running for new URI creation.
The template administrators will advise you on if you need to supply a URIGen API key when you submit new data.

When you are ready, click the submit button and the data will be uploaded to the Webulous server. The app may ask you at this stage to authorise that you e-mail address can be shared with the Webulous server.
The e-mail address you use to login to google will be used to send you notifications about your data submission. No other information is collected from your Google account.


=== Webulous Google Add-on FAQ

==== Can I create validations for multiple terms?

You can create a data validation using more than one terms. If you try and add a new validations over an existing data validatrion, the Webulous app will merge these validations. If you want to overide an exsiting validation you must
 remove it first.

==== Can I create validations on synonyms?

Validations on synonyms is not currently supported in the Webulous Add-on.

==== How do you access the ids/URIs for terms in the data validation?

Information about validations are stored in hidden sheets in the Google Sheet. You can find and shoe the hidden sheets in the View menu.

==== How do I create a validation from an ontology not in BioPortal?

You must use the Webulous server if you want to create templates from ontologies outside of BioPortal.

==== How do I create a validation from the result of a DL query?

You must use the Webulous server if you want to create templates with data validations generated from DL queries.

==== Why is the Webulous Add-on slow?

Google sheets has limits on how many terms can go into a data validation. If you are trying to create a data validation of more than 5000 terms you can expect the performance to drop off. It is best to try and minimise the number of allowed values
in a validation, and split these over multiple columns if you have a lot of terms.

== Webulous server

You can use the Webulous server to manage your ontology building templates. Webulous has a flexible model for defining ontology building templates that can be used to build custom user interfaces, or loaded directly into Google Spreadsheets.
Webulous uses the Ontology Pre-Processing Language (OPPL) as a domain specific language  (DSL) for expressing ontology design patterns and provides services for instantiating those patterns from data submitted for a given template.
